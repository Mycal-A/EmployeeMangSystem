**Summary: Employee Management System**

The Employee Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP, HTML, Bootstrap, and MySQL. This system serves as an efficient and organized tool for managing employee data within an organization. It is designed to have two primary users: the admin and the employee, each with distinct roles and capabilities.

**Admin Features:**

1. **View Employee Data:** The admin can access a comprehensive list of all employees within the organization. This includes details such as name, contact information, role, and salary.

2. **Update Employee Details:** Admins have the authority to update and edit any employee's information. This is useful for keeping records accurate and up-to-date.

3. **Add New Employees:** Admins can add new employees to the system by inputting their personal and professional details. This feature streamlines the onboarding process.

4. **Delete Employee Records:** In cases where an employee leaves the organization, the admin can remove their records from the system, ensuring data hygiene.

**Employee Features:**

1. **View Personal Information:** Employees have limited access, allowing them to view only their own personal details, such as contact information.

2. **Edit Personal Information:** This feature enables employees to update their personal information, such as contact numbers or addresses, ensuring that their records remain accurate.

3. **View Role and Salary:** Employees can also view their designated role within the organization and their associated salary.

**Security Measures:**

The system incorporates session management to enhance security. When a user logs in, a session is created, which keeps them authenticated throughout their interaction with the application. This helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive employee data.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Efficiency:** The Employee Management System simplifies HR processes by providing a centralized platform for managing employee data. This reduces the need for manual record-keeping and paperwork.

2. **Accuracy:** With the ability to update and edit employee information, the system ensures that records are always accurate and up-to-date.

3. **Security:** Session management enhances security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.

4. **User-Friendly:** The system's user interface is designed with HTML and Bootstrap, making it user-friendly and accessible from various devices.

5. **Scalability:** The system can be scaled to accommodate the growing needs of the organization, making it a long-term solution for HR management.

**Conclusion:**

In summary, the Employee Management System is a valuable tool for organizations looking to streamline their HR processes. It empowers administrators to efficiently manage employee data, while employees can access and update their personal information as needed. With a focus on security and user-friendliness, this system contributes to improved data accuracy and overall organizational efficiency.
